# Pomodoro Clock

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks

Visit my version of implementing this method [here](https://clumsynite.github.io/js-pomodoro/)

This was the last project required for Freecodecamp's Front end Libraries Certification, which I have successfully completed.

Here's a [codepen.io link](https://codepen.io/ClumsyKnight/full/jOWRGRg), to view this project will all the tests included.

### Details: 
##### There are six steps in the original technique:
- Decide on the task to be done.
- Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
- Work on the task.
- End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
- If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes) and then return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6.
- After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
